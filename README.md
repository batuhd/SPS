**A minimalist, secure (i guess), personal note-taking and link-sharing feed.**

SPS is designed as a private micro-blogging tool for a single user. It allows you to quickly drop notes, save links, and view them in a real-time feed from any device. Its primary focus is simplicity and robust security, ensuring your personal data remains completely private.

## 🛡️ Security Architecture
Here is how we secured it:

### 1. Firebase Authentication

New user registration (Sign-up) has been **completely disabled** at the Firebase console level. Even if someone attempts to trigger the registration API programmatically, the request will be rejected by the server (`auth/operation-not-allowed`). Only the pre-configured administrator email can log in.

### 2. Firestore Security Rules (Whitelist)

The database rules check the user's specific email address against a whitelist.

* **Rule:** `allow read, write: if request.auth.token.email == "b@b.com";`
* *Result:* Even if someone manages to obtain valid credentials, they will see an empty feed unless their email matches the owner's email exactly.

### 3. API Key Domain Locking

The Google Cloud API keys used by the application are restricted to function only on the specific GitHub Pages domain of this project (e.g., `https://batuhd.github.io/*`). They are useless elsewhere.
